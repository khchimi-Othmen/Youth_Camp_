I am responsible for creating an online store as part of a web development project in a group setting. 
The online store uses a layered project architecture with multiple layers including MVC, AOP, DTO, Validator,
and custom exceptions. Additionally, it uses Stripe, PDF, and email APIs. JUnit was used to test the project's methods.
